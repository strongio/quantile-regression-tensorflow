# Tensorflow Deep Quantile Regression 

An preliminary implementation of deep quantile regression in tensorflow, inspired by [sachinruk's keras implementation](https://github.com/sachinruk/KerasQuantileModel). This allows you to fit an aribtrary number of quantiles simultaneously.

Compatible with Tensorflow 2.3.
